## Coming Soon (Future Prototypes)

We are continuously developing new prototypes to expand the utility of computational methods in theological research.



### 7. Translating PDFs and Generating Summaries using LLMs

This future prototype will showcase a workflow for translating PDF content, followed by generating a three-column output: original text, translated text, and a detailed summary of each passage, all powered by LLMs.

# Computational Methods in Theological Disciplines: Reusable Jupyter Notebook Code as Prototypes

## Overview

This repository provides a collection of computational method prototypes tailored for various theological disciplines. New examples and methods will be updated on a monthly basis, showcasing practical applications and interdisciplinary approaches.

## Current Prototypes

Each prototype is designed to be easily launched and explored. Click the "Launch in Jupyter" (for researcher affiliated in BW) or "Open in Colab" badge to open the example directly in a Jupyter or Colab environment.

### 1. Word Count Snippet

A foundational example demonstrating basic text analysis through word counting.

## Coming Soon (Future Prototypes)

We are continuously developing new prototypes to expand the utility of computational methods in theological research.

### 6. Sorting and Metadata Extraction for Archival Documents using LLMs

A forthcoming example that will explore methods for automatically organizing archival documents by date and extracting key metadata (e.g., Sender, Receiver, summary of content) from each scanned page using LLMs.

### 7. Translating PDFs and Generating Summaries using LLMs

This future prototype will showcase a workflow for translating PDF content, followed by generating a three-column output: original text, translated text, and a detailed summary of each passage, all powered by LLMs.
